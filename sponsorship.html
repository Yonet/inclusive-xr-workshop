        <h3 id="sponsorship">Becoming a Sponsor</h3>
        <p>W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from industry, research, government, and the developer community.</p>
        <p>Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse international audience setting W3C&#39;s strategic direction, sponsorship helps your organization reach W3C&#39;s engaged participants.</p>
        <p>Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are subject to W3C approval.</p>
