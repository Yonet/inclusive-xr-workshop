        <dd><p>A recent graduate from the Master's program at the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington finishing his research work in the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology pertaining to improving the accessibility of the input side of XR technology.</p>
          <p>His specific work is creating an abstraction layer to allow arbitrary input devices to manipulate the standard interactions found in most XR applications. Due to its wider reaching demographics and more open source XR frameworks, a prototype of his work has been developed as a plugin for the framework A-Frame on WebXR, which can be integrated into existing applications to allow manipulation by a wider array of inputs.</p>
          <p>Beyond his current research work he has developed a variety of VR and AR applications on various platforms with multiple prior projects in WebVR and a sampling of his work can be found on his <a href="http://jakers.tech">personal website jakers.tech</a>. he was also a participant of the XR Access Symposium in New York City this last summer within the Standards and Policy breakout group.</p></dd>

          <p>Wendy is the PI for a NSF grant (award #1811509) with a focus on developing a XR platform that will allow deaf and hard-of-hearing participants to receive real-time signed and captioned instruction while still interacting with spontaneous and live exhibits at science centers and planetariums.</p></dd>

        <dt>Dolphin, Christopher <em>(Liv)</em></dt>
        <dd><p>Lead Frontend Developer at Liv Inc., a company that provides a popular mixed reality streaming solution. The company has an interest in participating in open standards. He personally has a huge interest in how tech can be more inclusive and accessible while removing some of the barriers that exist in everyday life.</p>
          <p><a href="https://likethemammal.com/">personal site</a></p>
          <p>He is a mostly self-taught developer. Since he had to learn from open-source and documentation, he has had a huge interest in how things can be presented better for the learner. That interest lead to a broader interest in accessibility, UX, and developer experience, which pair well with how the web has grown. As VR, AR, and XR have become more prevalent he has become interested in their respective design challenges as well, since they open up a new realm of possibility and access.</p></dd>

        <dt>Hakkinen, Markku <em>(Educational Testing Service)</em></dt>
        <dd><p>PhD. Director of Accessibility Standards and Inclusive Technology at Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton. Docent (Adjunct Professor) in Information Technology at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland</p>
          <p>can be found on LinkedIn, <a href="https://twitter.com/mhakkinen">mhakkinen on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mhakkinen">mhakkinen on Github; <a href="http://www.talkinginterfaces.org">personal web site</a></p></dd>

        <p>He has longstanding interest in accessibility, and in particular, non-visual interfaces to complex tasks. His work in accessibility standards began in the mid 90's and he currently participates in several W3C groups.</p>
        <p>XR is of interest in educational assessments, and we have seen a variety of AR/VR applications ranging from STEM simulations to language learning. For ETS a critical challenge with XR is to remain true to the goal of an inclusive learning environment that supports all students, including those with disabilities.</p>
        <p>There are other challenges, but he believes the key is to develop an understanding of the technologies and the role that well thought out standards can play to enable accessibility, particularly when specific technical adaptations needed to make XR usable may not be well understood without further research. Innovative technologies should not be designed to preclude accessibility (or at least make it difficult).</p>
        <p>He has specific interest in the role of speech/non-speech audio and haptics in XR in the expectation that these modalities can help make the XR environments more realistic, and enable natural interaction. This implies making sure the standards contain sufficient richness to define information about the objects, scenes, and interactions that enables transforming/augmenting interactions in modalities appropriate to the users including sound and touch.</p>
